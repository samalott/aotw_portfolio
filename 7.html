    <div id="page7b">Reading Response to 
        <span class="reading-title">Selections from Second Thoughts</span> 
        by Ulises Carrión
    </div>
    <div id="page7c">The thought I kept coming back to with this reading is that, for an essay that was originally 
        published, in Spanish, in some type of print publication, is being read by us today in English, in a digital format.
        I think the framework Carrión outlines is a fascinating and helpful tool for evaluating different types of media, 
        though I'm interested in the obvious question: how does digital media fit in? When the same content is viewed 
        through a screen, how does that change the nature of the piece of art/literature/etc. in question?
        I also thought the final line, "Our scheme serves only practical purposes and hasn't any further pretensions" 
        didn't feel entirely true. Or, if that was the intent, many of the statements made earlier in the essay make me 
        question whether or not there isn't some personal bias on Carrión's part that may have been unintentionally
        incorporated into the framework.

    <div id="page7b">Reading Response to 
        <span class="reading-title">Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully</span> 
        by Laurel Schwulst & Édouard U
    </div>
    <div id="page7c">I found both of these essays really thought provoking, and I resonated with them a lot 
        (plus anyone who quotes Octavia Butler automatically gets a win in my book!) 
        I found the variety of metaphors that Schwultz used to describe what individual websites, and the internet 
        as a whole, could be. The differences between the metaphors also helped convey the constantly changing state 
        of the internet, especially since they were all very "nature" based comparisons. 
        I also found Édouard U's view of information ("Nothing exists in isolation" and "conceptual isolation creates
        the death of meaning") did an incredible job capturing a personal philosophy of my own. 
        In my own experiences, learning by pulling on interesting threads and going deep into rabbit holes has 
        taught me infinitely more than a single linear experience has.

        One of the most interesting points I took from this reading was looking at how different cultural contexts 
        (in this case different regions of Italy) can expose the false dichotomies that might appear established in 
        other parts of the world... or might just be wrong. Even within this reading, I felt there was a distinction
         between print/text and film/video that didn't entirely sit right with me. Yes, the digitization of film 
         might not have altered some viewings, but I would argue it has significantly changed the role of movies, 
         and more specifically, movie theaters in our culture (along with some help from COVID). 
         It is no longer the default that a new movie, even a major blockbuster (i.e. "Glass Onions") will be 
         viewable only in a theater, where the experience is shared with a large mass of strangers. 
         That transition could not have happened without the digitization of film in the first place.

        In the past year or so, as I've started to learn more about programming, 
        I very quickly came to understand how little I actually understood about computers, 
        particularly in the basics ways they function. I really appreciated Chun's thoughts on how 
        "abstraction both empowers the programmer and insists on his/her ignorance." 
        I think the point about how this move towards representation and simplification also leads 
        to the democratization of programming (in some ways) is a really interesting way. 
        It made me think about why we have a propensity to think that people who understand the most 
        detailed (and sometimes irrelevant or outdated) information on a topic is the de facto expert, 
        even if another individual can use abstracted tools to greater ends.
